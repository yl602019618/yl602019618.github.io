# About Me

<img src="https://yl602019618.github.io/zhijunzeng.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Zhijun Zeng (Bob, 曾祉竣)**.<br>

Hello, I’m Zhijun Zeng (Bob). I am currently pursuing my PhD at the Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zuoqiang Shi](https://shizqi.github.io/). I also had the privilege of serving as a visiting scholar with [Prof. Yunan Yang](https://yunany.github.io/) at Cornell University. Prior to joining Tsinghua, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.
 I’m always eager to explore new ideas, discuss ongoing projects, and seek out collaborative opportunities. Please feel free to get in touch at **zengzj22 [at] mails.tsinghua.edu.cn.**
